            <h2>Explanation:</h2>
            <p>
                According to the Bhagavad Gita, the three gunas—Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas—represent fundamental qualities
                that influence human behavior and consciousness.
            </p>
            <h3>Sattva:</h3>
            <p>
                Sattva is the mode of goodness and represents purity, harmony, and virtue. Individuals dominated by Sattva
                exhibit qualities such as wisdom, compassion, and a balanced mind. They tend to pursue spiritual growth and
                self-realization.
            </p>
            <h3>Rajas:</h3>
            <p>
                Rajas is the mode of passion and denotes activity, desire, and restlessness. Those influenced by Rajas are
                driven by ambition, achievement, and material pursuits. While Rajas can lead to success, it may also lead to
                attachment and ego.
            </p>
            <h3>Tamas:</h3>
            <p>
                Tamas is the mode of ignorance and signifies inertia, lethargy, and delusion. Individuals in the grip of
                Tamas may exhibit laziness, ignorance, and a lack of clarity. Breaking free from Tamas requires conscious
                effort towards self-improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lord Krishna in the Gita advises individuals to strive for a balance of the gunas, emphasizing the cultivation
                of Sattva for spiritual evolution.
